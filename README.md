## Purpose
This project is a lightweight `.NET 8` client library designed for APIs adhering to the `json:api` standard. It offers an EF Core-like experience for querying data from `json:api` endpoints, simplifying integration and development workflows.

The library was born out of the need for an easy-to-use solution to fetch data from `HTTP` endpoints in a microservice architecture, where some services act as data providers and others as consumers. Its intuitive design makes it an excellent companion to the [https://www.jsonapi.net/index.html](JsonApiDotNetCore) library, as both adhere to the same standard, ensuring seamless interoperability.
